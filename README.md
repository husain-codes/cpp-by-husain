# 📘 cpp-by-husain

Welcome to **cpp-by-husain** — a structured, chapter-wise journey through modern C++.

This repository is organized like a hands-on course or book: starting from the absolute basics and gradually building up to advanced topics like STL, memory management, and multithreading.

## ✅ Chapter 3 - Functions & Recursion

This chapter covers everything you need to know about defining, calling, and organizing functions in C++ — from basic function syntax to advanced patterns like recursion and overloading.  

### 📚 Topics Included  

- **Function Basics** — declaration, definition, and calling  
- **Passing Arguments** — pass-by-value, pass-by-reference, and `const` references  
- **Default Arguments** — setting default values for parameters  
- **Inline Functions** — performance benefits and when to use them  
- **Function Overloading** — multiple functions with the same name but different parameters  
- **Recursion** — direct and indirect recursion, base and recursive cases  
- **Static Variables in Functions** — maintaining state across calls  
- **Function Prototypes & Header Files** — separating declaration from definition  
- **Scope & Lifetime of Variables** — local, global, and static scope rules  
- **Returning Values & Multiple Returns** — returning by value, reference, and pointer  
- **Const-Correctness in Functions** — enforcing immutability where needed  
- **Recursive Problem Solving Patterns** — factorial, Fibonacci, divide & conquer
